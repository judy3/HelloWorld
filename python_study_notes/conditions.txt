# the variable assignment is done using a single "="
# comparison between two variables is done using the double equals operator "==". The "not equals" operator is marked as "!="

# The "and" and "or" boolean operatiors

name = "John"
if name in ["John", "Rick"]:
print("Your name is either John or Rick.")
# the "in" operator could be used to check if a specific object exists within an iterable object container, such as a list

print(not False) # Prints out True
print((not False) == (False)) # Prints out False
# Using "not" before a boolean expression inverts it
