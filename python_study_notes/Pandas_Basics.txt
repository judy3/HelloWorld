Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.

There are several ways to create a DataFrame. One way way is to use a dictionary. 

dict = {"country": ["Brazil", "Russia", "India", "China", "South Africa"],
       "capital": ["Brasilia", "Moscow", "New Dehli", "Beijing", "Pretoria"],
       "area": [8.516, 17.10, 3.286, 9.597, 1.221],
       "population": [200.4, 143.5, 1252, 1357, 52.98] }

import pandas as pd
brics = pd.DataFrame(dict)
print(brics)


cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

# Print out cars
print(cars)
##Output:
      cars_per_cap        country drives_right
    US            809  United States         True
    AUS           731      Australia        False
    JAP           588          Japan        False
    IN             18          India        False
    RU            200         Russia         True
    MOR            70        Morocco         True
    EG             45          Egypt         True

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)
#print(cars)

# Print out country column as Pandas Series
print(cars['cars_per_cap'])

# Print out country column as Pandas DataFrame
print(cars[['cars_per_cap']])

# Print out DataFrame with country and drives_right columns
print(cars[['cars_per_cap', 'country']])

# Print out first 4 observations
print(cars[0:4])

# Print out fifth and sixth observation
print(cars[4:6])

# Print out observation for Japan
print(cars.iloc[2])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt
print(cars.loc[['AUS', 'EG']])
