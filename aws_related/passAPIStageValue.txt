Background: 
Different systems are using the API url that provided by AWS API GATEWAY whose the backend is a lamdba function. 
We use different stage to differentiate requester so that need to pass stage value to lambda function.
Steps:
1, config different stages in AWS API GATEWAY
2, set up Mapping Templates in the Integration Request(API Gateway), examlpe:
Content-Type: application/json
{
"parameterName": "$input.params('parametername')",
"stage" : "$context.stage"
}
3,After change any configuration don't forget to deploy the api again
4,modify the lambda function, example in node.js:
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(event));
	  console.log('no3 '+JSON.stringify(event.stage));

the value of the event.stage is the value
